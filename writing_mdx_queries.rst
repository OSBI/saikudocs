MDX is a three dimensional query langauge designed to help write business related queries. When you use Saiku using the normal drag and drop mode, behind the scenes we write the MDX for you, but if you want to, you can write the MDX yourself and execute it against the Saiku server.

There are many resources available regarding MDX query writing available on line. To create a MDX based query in Saiku, create a new query like usual and select a cube from the cube list. Then press the Switch to MDX mode button, this will drop you down into MDX mode where you will see an editor with a query stub in it for you. Once you have written the query you can then press the execute button, or Ctrl-Enter and it will be run for you and the resultset displayed.
